# Predictive Maintenance Project Plan

## Project Overview
The predictive maintenance project aims to develop machine learning models for predicting machine failures and identifying the type of failure in milling equipment. The project will leverage the AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset to train and evaluate supervised learning models. The ultimate goal is to propose predictive maintenance solutions that can help industries reduce unexpected downtime and maintenance costs.

## Project Objectives
- Develop models for predicting machine failures (binary classification).
- Develop models for identifying the type of machine failure (multi-class classification).
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Document findings, insights, and recommendations for stakeholders.
- Deliver a well-documented and reproducible project.

## Project Phases
