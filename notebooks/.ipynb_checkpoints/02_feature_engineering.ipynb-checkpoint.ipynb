    "## Description:\n",
    "In the Predictive Maintenance with Supervised Learning project, the Feature Engineering notebook (02_feature_engineering.ipynb) plays a crucial role in preparing the data for model training and improving the predictive performance of the machine learning models. Feature engineering involves creating new features, transforming existing ones, or selecting subsets of features to enhance the model's ability to capture patterns and make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "The primary objective of this notebook is to engineer informative and predictive features from the raw data collected from industrial machines. By crafting meaningful features, we aim to improve the model's ability to detect machine failures and predict their occurrence, thereby enabling proactive maintenance strategies."
